     Accomplishments:
          - added Settings and tested them
               * The setting load and save correctly
               * When changing setting while the server is running they will be overwritten on disable
          - worked on the readme
          - though of some ways to make the runables work
          - the database also works with SQLite now

     Problems:
          - Haven't quite worked out the runables yet, but getting there
          - Haven't decided on a lanuage for the webInterface yet, might be Node.js or Php
          - When changing setting while the server is running they will be overwritten on disable, might work on a workaround
